# Testimonials

> “I saw a presentation of TextileTechnologies’ RouteManager software at a CSC meeting in 2001. We switched from our prior route accounting software shortly after and we’ve never looked back. Every enhancement we could think of has been implemented and the commitment to personal service continues every day.”

> "We have been with TextileTechnologies for over 15 years. In that time, they have grown with us and their staff has provided us with top notch service. I cannot imagine finding an easier to use or more in-depth program. From the standard programming to handhelds to their WebManager, their products are second to none.”
